# Body Leveling key points

Given the hexapod in a certain position.
We monitor the height (and constant width) in each connection to the body i.e. coxa.

Let's first consider a simple scenario in 2D:

The axes in which we consider the problem are y and z (x is equal) so: $h=h_1-h_2$ and $w=w_1-w_2$ (constant)

```math
\frac{1}{2}
